Hi,everyone. Welcome to JPocket! 

I am JPocket Butler. i am here to service you on using JPocket,i know everything about JPocket,
just feel free to ask me . As i have got some question from my users and those question seems quite
common, therefore i concatenated them into following question showed below.

THE PURPOSE OF JPocket:
User X: Hi, Butler.Answer me ,What is the purpose of JPocket?
Me: JPocket is to help relaxing your server's workload and gear up your website response time .

User X: How could it relax my server's workload?
Me: most of time ,server will resend the data to user when user refresh the page.it always take a lot time
to load  thte same data again .By using JPocket, your server just need to send the data once,then the browser will
keep the data for you .

User X:Alright, How about gear up my website response time ?
Me:Sure, Imagine that you live near to countryside ,you are going to buy food in supermarket .. whether you prefer to buy
all you need at once ,or buying few thing then go home and go to supermarket for few time ? the answer is obvious...Well,
JPocket helps keeping your data organized .that why you can reuse the data without travelling back to server for the same thing.
